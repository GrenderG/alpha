# Database browser for the WoW Alpha Core project

This is intended for browsing the database used in: https://github.com/The-Alpha-Project/alpha-core/

On the main menu click on one of the main parts of the database to browse.

Then you can enter a filter (search) selection by entering some text. This is treated as a regular expression.

You can enter a database ID (number) directly to go to that item. For example, 4949 to view Thrall. Or just type in "Thrall".
